## HikingPartner

This is school project, it was done entirely in C#. Three layer architecture.

The idea was to make something very similar to Blabla car, but just for outdoor activities.

Database has many-to-many relationship, which was broken to one-to-many. That relationship was between *Korisnik* and *Aktivnost*.
